# Multiple Disease Prediction using AI/ML 🩺

## 🏥 Project Overview

This is a Multiple Disease Prediction System built using Machine Learning and deployed with Streamlit Cloud. The system allows users to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on medical input parameters. The diseases covered in this project include:

Diabetes 🩸

Heart Disease ❤️

Parkinson's Disease 🧠

Lung Disease 🫁

Thyroid Disease 

This project is designed to assist medical practitioners and individuals in obtaining early predictions of potential diseases, enabling them to take necessary precautions and seek medical guidance.

## 🚀 Features

 User Authentication: Secure login system to restrict unauthorized access.

Interactive UI: Built using Streamlit, offering a clean and user-friendly interface.

Multiple Disease Prediction: Uses Machine Learning Models trained with relevant datasets.

Health Recommendations: Provides personalized health tips and lifestyle changes based on predictions.

Background Images: Integrated visually appealing medical-themed backgrounds.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Streamlit 🎨 (for UI and deployment)

Scikit-Learn 🤖 (for machine learning models)

NumPy 📊 (for data processing)

Pickle 🗄️ (for model storage and loading)

## 📂 Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/rakshitha385/Multiple-Disease-Prediction-using-AIML.git

Navigate to the project folder:

cd Multiple-Disease-Prediction-using-AIML
